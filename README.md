# [gpgpassman](http://www.simonizor.gq/linuxapps)

This is a fork of Simoniz0r's project gpgpassman, we kept the name because the program is mostly his!

In the Discord Linux chat, we realized this program is missing a feature, it's a GPG password manager, but doesn't verify updates well and could be used to abuse unsuspecting users.

The hopes for this project is that we'll be able to make the program safe for users. Please don't just download my fork BTW, i'll be making releases. There you will find the signed releases when they are done.
